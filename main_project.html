Although depression is the second most prevalent illness in the U.S. today, it ranks 68th (out of 235) in the amount of federal funding it receives. Funding must reflect these numbers in order to expand the research which provides the answers needed to fight mental health illnesses.

		<p class="body">There is currently no medical diagnosis for a variety of mental health illnesses like depression. Diagnosis is based on subjective criteria and people suffering from these diseases can slip through the cracks even when they seek help.
		<br>
		<br>Mental illnesses include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors. They are usually not thought about as "real" diseases, such as cancer because we can't always see the pain these diseases inflict. Scientists don't understand the root cause of these issues and the lack of federal funding reflects the stagnant nature of this important research.<p>
